# ðŸ•¸ Web Starter Kit

Want to get going on a modern web project but just _donâ€™t have the time_ to set
up a good dev/build process? Well boy howdy have you come to the right place!
My **Web Starter Kit** offers everything you need and more, including:

- [ES2015](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/) and [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) support
- A ready-to-edit [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) config
- A dev server with live reloading
- Linting tools

I guess thatâ€™s it but man does this thing _offer_ all that, you know?

_Note: You may also be interested in the [TypeScript version](https://github.com/ngscheurich/web-starter/tree/typescript)
of this project._

## Getting started

Clone this repo, but name it something cooler:

    $ git clone https://github.com/ngscheurich/web-starter.git blackmagickisland

Now hop on into your new directory and install the projectâ€™s JavaScript dependencies:

    npm install

Thatâ€™s it! Youâ€™re started!

## Development

To spin up the dev server, just:

    npm start

You should now have a web server listeningâ€”and serving your gameâ€”at http://localhost:8080. Cool.

## Production

Ready to distribute your game to the ravenous masses?

    npm build

This will make a production-ready version of your project in a directory called `dist`; toss it up on the Internet somewhere. [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) might be a good choice.

## Contributing

Pull requests are gladly accepted, however this is an admittedly opinionated setup based on my personal preferences. If youâ€™re looking to make big changes to workflow or tooling you should fork the project.

If you do submit a PR, please adhere to the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ngscheurich/web-starter/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
